Plan for Replicating Mobile App Functionality in Web App
Based on my analysis of both applications, here's what needs to be implemented in the web app to match the mobile app's functionality:

1. Enhanced Batch Management
   BatchesPage Enhancements:
   Advanced Filtering:
   Add filters for batch status (created, departed, arrived, delivered, closed)
   Add date filters for created date, departed date, and arrived date
   Add farm and packhouse filters
   Implement a more user-friendly filter UI with dropdown menus
   Weight Differential Display:
   Add weight differential information to batch cards
   Show original weight, reconciled weight, and percentage difference
   Use color coding to highlight significant weight differences
   Batch Status Workflow:
   Add visual indicators for batch status (icons, colors)
   Implement action buttons for status transitions (depart, arrive, close)
   Add confirmation dialogs for status changes
   BatchDetailPage Enhancements:
   Add a timeline component showing batch status history
   Implement crate listing with reconciliation status
   Add batch action buttons based on current status
   Display weight differential information prominently
2. Crate Management
   Create New Components:
   CrateSelectionPage: For selecting existing crates to add to a batch
   QRScannerComponent: For web-based QR code scanning (using device camera)
   ManualQREntryComponent: For manually entering QR codes
   Enhance Existing Components:
   Add ability to add crates to batches from the batch detail page
   Implement crate filtering and search functionality
   Add crate status indicators
3. Reconciliation Workflow
   ReconciliationPage Enhancements:
   Show reconciliation progress more prominently
   Add filtering for batches ready for reconciliation
   Implement a more intuitive UI for the reconciliation process
   ReconciliationDetailPage Enhancements:
   Add photo capture functionality (using device camera)
   Implement weight entry with differential calculation
   Add visual indicators for reconciliation status
   Implement batch closing functionality when reconciliation is complete
   Create New Components:
   CrateReconciliationPage: For reconciling individual crates
   ReconciliationScanPage: For scanning crates during reconciliation
4. Services and API Integration
   Create or Enhance Services:
   batchService.js: Implement all batch-related API calls
   crateService.js: Implement all crate-related API calls
   reconciliationService.js: Implement all reconciliation-related API calls
   cameraService.js: For handling photo capture in the web app
5. UI/UX Improvements
   Use consistent styling between mobile and web apps
   Implement responsive design for all components
   Add loading indicators and error handling
   Implement toast notifications for actions
   Implementation Strategy
   Start with enhancing the BatchesPage and BatchDetailPage
   Implement the reconciliation workflow components
   Add crate management functionality
   Implement the photo capture and QR scanning features
   Enhance the UI/UX to match the mobile app
   Technical Considerations
   For QR code scanning, you can use libraries like react-qr-reader
   For photo capture, use the Web Camera API
   Implement proper error handling and loading states
   Ensure responsive design for both desktop and mobile web usage
   Use Material-UI components for consistent styling
   Would you like me to provide more detailed code examples for any specific part of this implementation plan?
